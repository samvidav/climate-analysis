# Climate Analysis Toolkit

This is a set of python scripts designed to analyse climate datafiles.

If you're interested in collaborating, email me at XXX.ac.uk.

To install a copy of the toolkit, open the terminal and run:

  git clone git@github.com:samvidav/climate-analysis.git

**This code is currently in development and not all features will work**
